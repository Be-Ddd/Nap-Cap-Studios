//  This is the root class for your game. You need to use CU_ROOTCLASS in your
//  .cpp file to register this as the root with CUGL. Otherwise, it will not
//  know where to start. All root classes are subclasses of Application.
//
//  With that said, root classes often do not do all that much stuff. They
//  often delegate their work to individual scenes and just handle the scene
//  switching.
